# eslint-config-standard-for-preact

> Tying together all dependencies needed to install `eslint` using `standard` style for `preact`

This is nothing more than an installation bundle, really.

## Usage

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-standard-for-preact
eslint -c standard-for-preact src/
```

## Y THO

Because this makes it way easier to update package versions across multiple apps (and I like short `package.json` files for small projects).
